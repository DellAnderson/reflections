(missing first Lesson 01 reflections)

I can use git log and git diff to compare
versions of files by copying and pasting
the version numbers from log into the
diff command.   This allows easy comparisons
which are colored if I have configured git correctly.

How might using version control make you more confident
to make changes that could break something?
Knowing that I can always go back (or forward if I note
down the ID of the HEAD will make me less afraid to
experiement)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use it for Android code management as well as HTML/CSS web development.
I would also like to use for graphics if it did not require so much storage space
and if I did not already have a klunky system for working with image files.
