What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden file called .git  
This file is used to track changes in 
the directory in which the repository
was created.

How is the staging area different from 
the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate between
working directory and repository.  It offers
the ability to select which files to include
in a commit unit so commits can be more 
logically organized.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can do a git diff --staged  to see what changes
were made to the file.
